      Our first stop will be at the shipwreck of the San Jose, sunken in 1708 off the coast of Cartagena, Colombia.
    </div>
    <div class="tour1">
      We will use scuba diving gear and tour the sunken San Jose, exploring every area within the boat. The San Jose was a galleon part of the Spanish treasure fleet, carrying approximately 17 billion dollars today.

      Understanding how San Jose was wrecked and its effect helps us understand the conflict between the British and the Spanish. San Jose’s shipwreck was a massive hit on Spain’s economy, valued at around 17 billion dollars today. The San Jose was part of the Spanish treasure fleet, which linked Spain and its territories. These ships contained goods; such as lumber, silver, gold, and spices. The goods the San Jose was carrying were going to help finance the Spanish king’s war effort, but because none of it was recovered, by either side, the Spanish suffered a terrible defeat and setback, fueling their conflicts against the British.

    <div class="stop2">
      Our second stop will be at the Cape Coast Castle, built in 1653 on Victoria Rd, Cape Coast, Ghana.
    </div>
    <div class="tour2">
      We will tour the castle, stopping in various rooms and buildings that used to sell goods by the Dutch. As we arrive at the dungeon, the tour guide will distribute an image (see below) that depicts what the dungeon looked like before the restoration and the horrible living conditions, designed to further engage the participants due to curiosity and sympathy.

    Participants will also be handed out this primary source, which is an extensive report on the castle, containing the age, occupation, and number of children (for females) for 158 enslaved people, 75 male, 83 female, the youngest of age, 7 and the oldest, 53. Participants will pair up and record why they think enslavers kept records of their enslaved people and how the list dehumanizes them.

  <div class="theme2">
    Learning about how slave forts were used and how records of them were kept helps us also learn about the conflict and violence surrounding these slave forts. Many slave forts, were considered extremely valuable to all European powers. Specifically, the one we are touring, the Cape Coast Castle. The Dutch constructed this fort to sell goods and resources to Europe, and later it also sold enslaved Africans. Due to Europe’s high interest in these enslaved Africans, a dungeon was built beneath the fort. This dungeon could hold up to 1000 people waiting for export but with horrible living conditions. Because of the high demand for a large amount of enslaved people, there were various battles fought over this fort, exchanging hands 4 times.

    The Great Dismal Swamp

    </a>
  <div class="stop3">
    Our third stop will be at the Great Dismal Swamp, Mesic Islands in Virginia where maroons took refuge and used as an underground railroad to enjoy freedom.
  </div>
  <div class="tour3">
    We will tour the great dismal swamp by exploring multiple mesic islands (high and dry parts of the swamp). This will show us what harsh conditions the maroons had to live with.

  <div class="explain1">
    Image to be handed out during the tour, 1897 image of what the swamp looked like, which will show participants how the swamp has changed and what the living conditions were like back when maroons lived in the swamp (30 years after). Participants will record a video of themselves talking about 3 things they notice that are different about the swamp then vs now and how it might have affected the maroons’ lives.
  </div>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred:_A_Tale_of_the_Great_Dismal_Swamp">
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Stowe_Dred_first_edition.jpg" class="image8">
    </a>
    <div class="primary2">
    Participants will also be handed out this primary source, a book, Dred: A Tale of the Great Dismal Swamp, written by Harriet Beecher Stowe. Stowe was an abolitionist and wrote this book so that people could understand the lives of maroons living in the great dismal swamp. To make things easier, participants will also be handed a plot summary of the book, which includes the major themes, but the participants must record a video explaining why these themes were conveyed and what impact Stowe was trying to make.
  </div>
  <div class="theme3">
    Understanding Dred and the horrible living conditions that these maroons had to live through helps us know where they were coming from when they revolted. These maroons were fine staying in harsh living conditions like the swamps’, but only after they were attacked did they revolt. This goes to show how horrific slavery was and what lengths the maroons would go to ensure that they were not enslaved. These lengths were often in the form of conflict and violence.

  Our Fourth stop will be at Nickel Fort, situated about 15 miles north of present-day Apalachicola, Florida. Nickel Fort was a fortification used by escaped enslaved people to resist people who wanted to return them to slavery.

  <div class="tour4">
    We will tour the fort by walking around its perimeters and giving out photocopies of the image on screen. Although it is displayed on the site, it can often be hard to fully read and understand a document while trying to look over multiple people’s shoulders. This image gives a backstory on the fort and also gives some valuable insight into what the fort used to look like.
  </div>
  <div class="theme4">
    Understanding the battle of Prospect Bluff helps us understand the conflict and violence between escaped enslaved people and European Americans trying to return them to slavery. Escaped enslaved individuals rarely had a level playing field with people trying to return them to slavery because of the resources, connections, and weapons they had. However, this fort gave maroons tons of firepower, specifically, over 2,500 muskets, 50 carbines, and 400 pistols. Even though the maroons lost, “It is the largest and best-known instance before the American Civil War in which armed fugitive Africans (they were no longer enslaved) resisted European Americans who sought to return them to slavery.”

    Our final stop will be at Boïs Caïman, Vaudreuil, Haiti. Boïs Caïman was a ritual made for enslaved people and marked the very start of the Haitian revolution.

</a>
  <div class="tour5">
    We will tour the grounds of Boïs Caïman by exploring different parts of the historical site, specifically the ones with statues. We will also take a look at the mural. We will distribute this image that depicts what happened during the battle that took forth after the ritual. (see below) Participants will talk amongst each other, sharing their thoughts and opinions on this image and how the enslaved people dealt with their situation.

<div class="primary3">
  Participants will also be given a copy of this primary source, a poem written by Herard Dumesle. Dumesle took testimonies to record his account of the ceremony. Translated and summarized, it says that god for the enslavers lets the enslavers do what they want while the enslaved people must work, but this poem is preaching against that, saying that god is here to help all of us.
</div>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bois_Ca%C3%AFman">
  <img src="PoemSource.png" class="image14">
</a>
<div class="theme5">
  Understanding the ceremony of Boïs Caïman helps us understand the conflict between the enslaved people and the enslavers. The poem reads that the enslavers have weaponized religion, more specifically, god against the enslaved people for the enslaved to do what they please and for the enslaved people to keep working. Pointing this out and offering a new idea; god wants to help all of us and therefore we should be free, helps unify and motivate the enslaved people to fight back and ultimately win and regain their freedom.
